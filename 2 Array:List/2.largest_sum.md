Find Maximum Number in List (Multiple Implementations)

This repository demonstrates various implementations to find the maximum number in a list of integers. The goal is to showcase different methods in different programming languages to solve the same problem of determining the largest number in a list.
Code Implementations

1. C++ Implementation
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;

int main(){
    int arr[]={1,2,3,4,10,-6,100,20};
    int max = INT_MIN;
    int size = sizeof(arr)/sizeof(arr[0]);
    for(int i=0; i<=size; i++){
        if(arr[i]>max){
            max = arr[i];
        }
    }
    cout << "The largest number is: " << max << endl;
    return 0;
}
Explanation:
This C++ program initializes an array of integers and iterates through it to find the largest number.
The variable max is set to INT_MIN initially, which is the smallest possible integer value, and it updates each time a larger number is found in the array.
The result is printed using cout.
2. JavaScript Implementation - Using Traditional Loop
let list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 100, 20, -10];
let max = 0;

for (let i = 0; i <= list.length; i++) {
    if (list[i] > max) {
        max = list[i];
    }
}

console.log("The largest number is: ", max);
Explanation:
This JavaScript implementation uses a traditional for loop to find the largest number in the list array.
Initially, the max variable is set to 0, and the loop iterates through the list, updating max if a larger number is found.
Finally, the largest number is printed using console.log.
3. JavaScript Implementation - Using map Method
let randomMax = 0;
const maximum = list.map(num => {
    if (num > randomMax) {
        randomMax = num;
    }
});
console.log("The largest number is: ", randomMax);
Explanation:
This JavaScript code uses the map method to iterate over the array and find the largest number.
The randomMax variable keeps track of the largest number encountered during the iteration.
Although map is typically used for transforming data, here itâ€™s used in a non-standard way to update the maximum value.
4. JavaScript Implementation - Using Math.max()
console.log("The largest number is: ", Math.max(...list));
Explanation:
The Math.max() method is used here to directly find the largest number in the list array.
The spread operator (...) is used to pass all the elements of the array as arguments to Math.max().
This is a concise and efficient way to find the largest number.
5. JavaScript Implementation - Using reduce() Method
let reduceMax = list.reduce((accumulator, currentValue) => {
    return Math.max(accumulator, currentValue);
}, list[0]);
console.log("The largest number is: ", reduceMax);
Explanation:
This implementation uses the reduce() method to iterate through the list and find the largest number.
The accumulator keeps track of the current maximum, and at each step, Math.max() is used to compare and update it.
The list[0] is used as the initial value for accumulator.
6. Python Implementation
list = [1, 2, 3, -1, 20, 100, 23]
maximum = 0

for i in range(0, len(list)):
    if(list[i] > maximum):
        maximum = list[i]

print("The largest number is: ", maximum)
print("The largest number is: ", max(list))
Explanation:
This Python code iterates over a list of integers and updates the maximum variable if a larger number is found.
It also demonstrates the use of Python's built-in max() function to find the largest number in the list.
Technologies Used

C++ for the initial array-based loop approach.
JavaScript for different ways to find the largest number, including using loops, map(), reduce(), and built-in Math.max().
Python for demonstrating a traditional loop and built-in max() function.
How to Run

C++ Code:
Use a C++ compiler (e.g., g++) to compile the code and run the executable.
Command: g++ main.cpp -o main && ./main
JavaScript Code:
Save the JavaScript code to a .js file and run it using Node.js.
Command: node filename.js
Python Code:
Save the Python code to a .py file and run it using Python.
Command: python filename.py
