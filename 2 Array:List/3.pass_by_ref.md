Pass by Reference - C++, Python, and JavaScript

This repository demonstrates the concept of Pass by Reference in three different programming languages: C++, Python, and JavaScript. Each example shows how modifying an array or list inside a function affects the original array or list due to the passing mechanism.
Concept: Pass by Reference

In Pass by Reference, the function receives the memory address of the argument passed to it, allowing modifications made within the function to directly affect the original argument outside the function. This is different from Pass by Value, where a copy of the argument is passed, and changes within the function do not affect the original.
C++ Example
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;

void changeArr(int arr[], int size){
    // Pass by reference (array in C++ is passed by reference)
    for(int i=0; i<size; i++){
        arr[i] = 2 * arr[i];  // Modifies the original array
    }
}

int main() {
    int arr[] = {1, 2, 3};
    int size = sizeof(arr)/sizeof(arr[0]);
    changeArr(arr, size);  // Modifies the original array
    for(int i=0; i<size; i++){
        cout << arr[i] << endl;  // Outputs: 2, 4, 6
    }
    return 0;
}
Explanation:
In C++, arrays are passed by reference by default. This means that the function can modify the original array directly. In this example, each element of the array is multiplied by 2.
Python Example
def changeArr(arr):
    # Pass by reference (mutable object - list)
    for i in range(len(arr)):
        arr[i] = 2 * arr[i]  # Modifies the original list

arr = [1, 2, 3]
changeArr(arr)  # Modifies the original list
for num in arr:
    print(num)  # Outputs: 2, 4, 6
Explanation:
In Python, lists (mutable objects) are passed by reference. This means that any changes made to the list inside the function will affect the original list.
The function changeArr doubles each element of the list arr.
JavaScript Example
function changeArr(arr) {
    // Pass by reference (mutable object - array)
    for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
        arr[i] = 2 * arr[i];  // Modifies the original array
    }
}

let arr = [1, 2, 3];
changeArr(arr);  // Modifies the original array
arr.forEach(num => console.log(num));  // Outputs: 2, 4, 6
Explanation:
In JavaScript, arrays are passed by reference, so modifications made to the array inside the function affect the original array.
The changeArr function doubles each element of the array arr.
Key Concepts

Pass by Reference allows a function to modify the original argument.
Mutable objects like arrays and lists are passed by reference in C++, Python, and JavaScript.
Immutables (e.g., primitive data types like int, float in Python) behave differently: their values can't be modified directly inside the function unless returned and reassigned.
Differences Across Languages

C++: Arrays are always passed by reference, so changes made in the function reflect outside.
Python: Lists (and other mutable types like dictionaries) are passed by reference, meaning modifications inside the function will change the original list.
JavaScript: Arrays (and objects) are passed by reference. Functions can modify the contents of the array or object passed to them.
How to Run the Examples

C++:
Save the C++ code in a file, e.g., main.cpp.
Compile the code using a C++ compiler:
g++ main.cpp -o main
./main
Python:
Save the Python code in a file, e.g., main.py.
Run the Python code using Python:
python main.py
JavaScript:
Save the JavaScript code in a file, e.g., main.js.
Run the JavaScript code using Node.js:
node main.js


Arrays are passed by reference because arrays in C++ are implemented as pointers, and when an array is passed to a function, what is actually passed is the pointer to the first element, which means changes inside the function will affect the original array.

Primitive types like int, double, char, etc., are passed by value, which means the function works with a copy of the value, and changes do not affect the original variable.
