Key Differences:
1. **do-while loop**:
   - **Python**: Does not have a built-in `do-while` loop. You can simulate it using a `while` loop by ensuring the body of the loop is executed at least once before checking the condition.
   - **JavaScript**: Uses the `do` keyword followed by a block of code. The condition is checked after the code block is executed, ensuring that the loop runs at least once. The condition is written inside the `while` keyword after the block of code.
   - **C++**: Similar to JavaScript, uses `do` followed by a block of code and then checks the condition with `while` at the end. The loop ensures the block executes at least once before evaluating the condition.

2. **Loop Structure**:
   - **Python**: Python does not have a `do-while` loop, but you can simulate it using a `while` loop with a condition that ensures the loop runs at least once. A `while True` with a `break` condition can simulate a `do-while`.
   - **JavaScript & C++**: Both have a `do-while` loop structure, where the body of the loop is executed first, and then the condition is checked.

3. **Condition Check**:
   - In **Python**, you would have to manually check the condition after the loop has executed once.
   - **JavaScript** and **C++** automatically check the condition after each iteration, meaning that the loop will always run at least once regardless of the condition.

Example:

**Python** (simulated using `while` loop):
x = 0
while True:
    print(x)
    x += 1
    if x >= 5:
    break

**JavaScript**:
let x = 0;
do
    {
        console.log(x);
        x++;
     }
    while (x < 5);

**C++**:
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main()
    {
        int x = 0;
        do
        {
            cout << x << endl;
            x++;
        }
        while (x < 5);
        return 0;
    }

Note:
- **Python** does not support a native `do-while` loop, so you must simulate it using a `while True` loop with a `break` statement to terminate after one or more iterations.
- **JavaScript** and **C++** both support the `do-while` loop, where the condition is checked after the loopâ€™s body is executed, guaranteeing at least one execution.
